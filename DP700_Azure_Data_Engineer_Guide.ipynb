    "## Question 1: Storage Selection\n",
    "**Scenario**: Need to store 500GB of data for real-time analytics on structured data.\n",
    "Which storage should you choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Azure Cosmos DB\n",
    "B) Azure SQL Database\n",
    "C) Synapse Analytics\n",
    "D) Data Lake Storage only\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: C (Synapse Analytics)\n",
    "**Explanation**: Synapse is designed for analytics on structured data at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2: Incremental Loading\n",
    "**Scenario**: Load new records from source table since last execution.\n",
    "Which approach is MOST efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Full load every time\n",
    "B) Use watermark with timestamp column\n",
    "C) Manual script to identify changes\n",
    "D) Delete and recreate table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: B (Watermark pattern)\n",
    "**Explanation**: Watermark tracks changes efficiently using timestamps.\n",
